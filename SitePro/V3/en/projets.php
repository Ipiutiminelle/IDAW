<h1 class="description1">I want to make money with my questionable knowledge in web development. <br> Here's an example
    of one of my poems, about my story, with a bovine touch: </h1>

        <h2>

            "In the darkness of a cunning and deceitful soul, <br>
            A dark desire lurks, slips, corroborates,<br>
            "I want to make money," proclaims the wicked voice,<br>
            But the price to pay is more than just a wrinkle.<br>
            <br>
            My fraudulent knowledge, a corrupted wisdom,<br>
            Weaves a dark web, a defunct destiny,<br>
            In web development, I lose myself in deception,<br>
            The bovine greed &#128004 guides my betrayed steps.<br>
            <br>
            Lines of code, a labyrinth of dupes,<br>
            Where lies, tricks, and wolves intertwine,<br>
            Fictitious projects, empty promises,<br>
            In this quest for money, everything seems to unravel.<br>
            <br>
            Deceived clients, betrayed partners,<br>
            In this sinister game, everything ends up shaken,<br>
            My bovine &#128004 appetite for ill-gotten profit,<br>
            Drags me into an abyss where everything fades away.<br>
            <br>
            Karma, like cattle, silently roams,<br>
            Ready to remind me of my betrayal, my madness,<br>
            The bovines &#128004 of justice bellow in the night,<br>
            My fateful destiny unfolds relentlessly.<br>
            <br>
            In this tragic poem, the moral is clear,<br>
            That bovine greed &#128004 leads us to misery,<br>
            Fraudulent knowledge may seduce,<br>
            But at the end of the road, it's the fall that attracts."
